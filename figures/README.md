|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `divergence` | Regulator validation plots                    | Pre-rendered |
| `quantum`    | Jaynes-Cummings / cavity QED dynamics         | Pre-rendered |
| `signal`     | Signal detection experiment results           | Pre-rendered |

Figures were generated from experimental scripts during research. The scripts depend on unpublished simulation code and are not yet packaged for independent reproduction.
